# Algorithmic Complexity

This repo details my workings through the Algorithmic Complexity material from the Makers Academy course (https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/algorithmic_complexity)

## Timing

The first section involves timing how long the following Ruby methods take to run:

- last
- reverse
- shuffle
- sort

I did this by using ```Benchmark``` in Ruby, running the methods against an array populated with random numbers between 1 and 9. The code can be found in the 'code-timer.rb' file.
